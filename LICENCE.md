# LICENCE

## This is not your usual licence

The EDUC-8 was developed and published by "Electronics Australia" magazine, and the copyright rests with Silicon Chip Publications (www.siliconchip.com.au).  The design is subject to Australian and International Copyright laws.  The design is the work of Jaimeson (Jim) Rowe.

My work is a hommage to the original.  While the VHDL included here is my work, none of would be possible without Jim Rowe and the publishers.

I have received E-Mail confirmation from the publishers that I am permitted to make my code public for non-commercial and general interest use.  The management have been very reasonable, and could well have told me I can't publish it but instead they have been more than reasonable.  I therefore insist that you respect their copyright with regard to this design.  Reprints of the original articles are available from Silicon Chip Publications and are well worth the cost for the amount of knowledge you will gain.

In summary, "Enjoy" and "Play Nicely"
